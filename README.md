# 11 Express.js: Note Taker

## Description

This application is meant to be used as a medium through which people can write and save notes for themsevles. It can be used as a to-do list reminder, as a place to write down what groceries one needs for a certain recipe, and anything else that may be of use in writing things down at an easy-to-access location online. The front-end had already been developed and provided, and in order to make the application functional, I worked on building the back-end and connecting the two. In making this project, I really improved my knowledge on writing app.post and also solified the basics one needs to write code from the back end and connect it to a server.

## Installation
